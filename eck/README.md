# ECK-015 — Four Cloverleaf Fields Around One Singlet

One primitive; position, chroma, wavelength, chronos; three witness **display slots**. The UI is a testbed, not a live independent witness quorum.

## New invariant

Every observation **and every calibration** is appended as a typed leaf in the same domain-separated SHA-256 Merkle tree. After pinning a head in memory, the prefix through its recorded leaf count must still rehash to that root before another event or checkpoint can be accepted.

`event_root(N)` binds the complete sequence of typed records. The raw observation contains the four wheel positions and its own SHA-256 leaf digest. A calibration leaf binds the original observation index and parent digest, the wheel name/key, original value, signed offset and derived result. It never changes the raw sample.

### Four wheels

- POSITION, degrees: spatial-phase illustrative calibration
- CHROMA, degrees: hue illustrative calibration
- WAVELENGTH, nm: illustrative wavelength offset (not hardware spectroscopy)
- CHRONOS, ms: illustrative sample-time offset (not a clock synchronization standard)

### Test coverage

`python eck/test_eck012.py`: authenticated current prefix, append extension, mutation of all four calibration offsets, deletion of each calibration, substitution of derived values, raw mutation, event reorder, truncation, stale head, unchanged raw and permitted append.

## Security boundary

The demo's checkpoint and data coexist inside one volatile browser tab; a hostile actor controlling *both* can replace both. This is **not independent custody**. The browser recomputes the old prefix (linear-size); it does **not** implement RFC 6962 compact consistency proofs. The three witness labels are not actual key-bearing witnesses. Browser controls demonstrate continuity without claiming trusted sensor measurements.

## Next invariant — ECK-013

Bind the entire event history to externally signed 2-of-3 custody receipts and a compact append-only consistency proof. Check each calibration's semantic parent linkage during verification, in addition to its Merkle membership.

## ECK-013: Wheels before witnesses

The centerpiece is now a live 3-panel coupling instrument:

- **Spectral estimate:** approximate RGB representation of the wavelength wheel (380–750 nm), with visible-band intensity taper. This is screen RGB, not a spectrometer, and not guaranteed to reproduce a physically accurate perceived color.
- **Chroma:** independent HSL hue wheel. The same hue can correspond to many spectra; a monochromatic wavelength is not interchangeable with a display hue.
- **Position × Chronos:** explicit illustrative phase composition `(position_degrees + (chronos_ms mod 360)) mod 360`. This is a demo visualization convention, not a physical conversion of milliseconds to angles.

All four wheel sliders update these views immediately; the prior authenticated event ledger remains below the instrument.

## Next natural invariant — ECK-014

Make coupling user-selectable, with independent, derived and latched modes. Record coupling model/version alongside derived state so an observer can reproduce exactly how a visual was produced. No silent physical assumptions.

## ECK-014 geometry correction

**Canonical layout:** four Chrome wheels orbit a single central singlet. The singlet is the shared reference point; the wheels are coordinates/dimensions of one observation, not four separate instruments or four separate evidence roots.

```text
                    POSITION
                       O
                       |
           CHRONOS O-- . --O CHROMA
                       |
                       O
                   WAVELENGTH

                   . = SINGLET
```

The browser visualization now places Position north, Chroma east, Wavelength south, Chronos west around a chrome-lit central dot. Updating the wheels updates central glow and derived display phase. This is graphical coupling, not evidence of physical causation or numerical identity between hue and wavelength. Earlier evidence event structures are retained.

## ECK-015: Three visual field-strength bands

Four independently adjustable **lobe intensity** controls surround the invariant central singlet. Each lobe receives a qualitative band: weak (< 1/3; cyan), medium (1/3 to < 2/3; amber), strong (>= 2/3; magenta). This is a user-defined field-intensity visualization, **not** a mapping of physical weak/strong nuclear interactions or a scientifically derived medium fundamental force.

Each wheel's glow and border reflect its field strength; the central dot stays at the same location and changes visual emphasis as aggregate intensity changes. Balanced means max-minus-min intensity below 0.08. Polarized means a larger spread. The existing evidence ledger remains below.

## Next natural invariant — ECK-016

Conserve total normalized field intensity as the four lobes exchange weight around the singlet, while permitting an explicitly tagged external excitation event to add or remove intensity.
